Course Overview
---------------

This page focuses on the course _3.054 Cellular Solids: Structure, Properties and Applications_ as it was taught by Dr. Lorna Gibson in Spring 2014.

This course spotlights the structure and mechanical behavior of honeycombs and foams; students apply models for the behavior of cellular solids to applications in engineering and medicine and to natural materials.

Course Outcomes
---------------

### Course Goals for Students

*   Learn about the structure of cellular materials and to understand how that structure can be related to mechanical or thermal properties of the materials.
*   Gain an appreciation of the broad range of cellular materials, and how similar principles can be applied to all of these materials.

### Possibilities for Further Study/Careers

Academic and industry careers, including biomedical engineering, orthopedics, osteoporosis, orthopedic materials, and materials for engineering applications.

----------

The students' grades were based on the following activities:

- 10% Problem sets (5)
- 30% Project
- 60% Tests (2)

Student Information
-------------------

![17 students took this course when it was offered in 2014.](/coursemedia/3-054-cellular-solids-structure-properties-and-applications-spring-2015/5d0fa01f4a524ca28005d1d0462f3724_3-054_stat-students.png)

### Breakdown by Year

Undergraduates (mostly juniors or seniors), and graduate students.

### Breakdown by Major

Mainly material science and engineering students.

### Typical Student Background

Students must have taken a course in solid mechanics or mechanical behavior of material in order to be able to follow the derivations and understand what goes on in this course.
